And, as in any Public Transport System, the Scheduling Process provides the framework in which the Transport Service operates. It is responsible for the formulation of timetables, vehicle and crew scheduling, and crew rostering. Although this is the most important part of the transport system, it is the most difficult to manage. The varied inputs to the process, the lack of proper infrastructure and improper technology and processes available all lead to a unique problem in terms of Public Transportation Management in a developing country. Therefore it is imperative for a system to cater to these limitations and meet the demands of a developing country specifically. My research prototype proposes an alternative system to aid the Schedulers in their capacity to formulate timetables and schedule vehicles and crew. The system will also act as an information portal to commuters to obtain information about transport modes and associated routes as well as other related information. The project uses the case of the Western Province Bus Transportation System in Sri Lanka as an example to draw conclusions regarding the proposed information system.', 'Aftha_Jaldin.pdf'),
