The inaugural Career Fair, organized by the University of Colombo School of Computing aims to strengthen the ties between the academic and the corporate worlds.

It provides an opportunity for leading firms to recruit the best IT talent the UCSC has to offer in an organized, highly interactive environment.

The undergraduates in turn get an opportunity to showcase their talent and meet with prospective employers in a familiar setting.
